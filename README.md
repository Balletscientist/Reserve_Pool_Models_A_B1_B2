Honours Project: 3D Computational Modelling of Reserve Pool Dynamics in Presynaptic Terminal 

Supervisor: Prof. Melanie Stefan 

Lay Abstract

Our brain is made up of neurons, which communicate with each other by sending chemical messages called neurotransmitters. Before they are released, neurotransmitters are packed in containers called vesicles. It is important that vesicles are available upon demand, therefore neurons need to be able to store vesicles and make them quickly available when needed. This is controlled by specialised proteins. These proteins have been shown to play a crucial role in learning and memory.  But the experimental knowledge on mechanism behind this is still incomplete. In this work, I created a 3D computer model that recreates the mobilisation of vesicles and the proteins that control it. As Box said "All models are wrong, but some are useful" there are ways this work could be improved but the model does show that the precise spatial organisation of vesicles and proteins is important for their function. The model can also be used as a prototype for future research. Other computer modellers can extend the model by adding more details. Experimentalists can use the model to inform the research and can in turn feed the results back into the model. The model can also be used as a teaching tool to help students understand how neurons exchange messages and complex biological mechanisms.

Note

For general software download - go to mcell.org website and click on "Download" select appropriate operating system and follow the instructions. 

For Model_A - In default, visualisations are disabled in the blender files to decrease computational burden. To enable visualizations, go to Cellblender -> Visualization Settings -> Visualization -> tick "Export All" and tick "Enable Molecule Visualisation"

For Model_B1 & Model_B2 - instructions how to set a correct python interpreter in VS Code settings to allow visualisation once the python code is run and simulated in the terminal.
